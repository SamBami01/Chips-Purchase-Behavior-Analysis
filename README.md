# Chips-Purchase-Behavior-Analysis

# Customer Analytics

## Overview

This task explores customer transaction data for the chips category to uncover purchasing behaviors and inform business decisions. The analysis used R and included data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and customer segmentation insights.

---

## Objectives

- Understand transaction trends over time.
- Identify key purchasing behaviors across customer segments.
- Detect any data irregularities (e.g., missing days).
- Compare spending across lifestage and premium segments.

---

## Dataset

- **Transaction Data** (`QVI_transaction_data.csv`)
- **Customer Demographics** (`QVI_purchase_behaviour.csv`)

---

## Tools Used

- **R** (dplyr, lubridate, ggplot2, ggthemes, ggMosaic)
- **RStudio**
- **Data Wrangling & Visualization**

---

## Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Standardized column names.
   - Converted `DATE` to `Date` format.
   - Removed outliers in `PROD_QTY` (e.g. `PROD_QTY >= 200`).

2. **Merging Datasets**
   - Combined transaction data with customer demographic data for richer analysis.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extracted `PACK_SIZE` from product names using regex.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Trends in daily transactions.
   - Transaction patterns during December and Christmas.
   - Distribution of product pack sizes.

5. **Customer Segmentation Analysis**
   - Segmented by `LIFESTAGE` and `PREMIUM_CUSTOMER` flags.
   - Analyzed the number of customers, total sales, and average quantity purchased.
   - Tested statistical differences between key customer groups.
